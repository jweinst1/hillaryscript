#HillaryScript

`From the makers of BernieScript...`

HillaryScript is a programming language based on Hillary Clinton and her campaign for the presidency. It uses fun, hilarious syntax which gets right down to the nooks and crannies of writing a program.

The language transcompiles to JavaScript, so it's easy to use and experiment with. However, the language has quite a few special features that will get you pumped for election season.

##Installation

To install HillaryScript, you need to have NodeJS installed on your computer. In your terminal type:

```
npm install -g hillaryscript
```

##Language Guide

`HillaryScript` is a special language, because instead of using traditional constructs, like `for` loops, it is composed of a set of features far more representative of the principles of democracy, Hillary's campaign, and America.

###`CORRUPTION:`

Since a government always has the chance to become corrupt, HillaryScript is no different. Everytime you compile a `.hillary` file, the compiler may produce a corrupted output. A classfied example of this is as follows:

```
example.hillary
--------
vote a = 7
vote b = ExecutiveAction(){$ $}
```

Output:

```
v$$r* = $$**$$7
$$$$****$$$$$ function($$$$){}
```

One must take time and consideration to prevent such programs not becoming corrupt. Through trial and error, a programmer will adapt to producing corruption-free code.

###Voting

One of the most important aspects of HillaryScript, and democracy is voting. One cannot be a truly free and liberated citizen without exercising their right to vote. 

In HillaryScript, voting assigns some value to a name. For example:

```
vote f = 6
```

Now in any succeeding statement, the name f corresponds to the value 6. However, reassigning `f` through another vote statement erases the previous value. This is also good because people are fickle, you can change who you want to vote for before election day.

###Being With Her (Operators)

In most programming languages, operators are used to perform simple tasks like addition, subtraction, assignment, and more. However, HillaryScript doesn't just perform simple tasks, it brings people together under a common purpose, and unite them.

####Hill Plus

To perform addition in HillaryScript, also called unification, you use the `h+` operator. For example:

```
> 7 h+ 8
15
```

You can also use the Hill Plus operator for concatenation of strings.

```
> "Hillary" h+ "Clinton"
"HillaryClinton"
```
